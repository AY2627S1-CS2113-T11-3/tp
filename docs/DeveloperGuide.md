## Design & implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### Contact management

`add-c` follows the same structure as sessions: `Contact` is the validated data class,
`ContactManager` owns the list and prints confirmations, and `Parser` dispatches the commands.

The user guide did not specify the rules below. They are design decisions made when implementing the feature and
can be changed in `Contact` (validation) or `Parser` (`ADD_CONTACT_PREFIXES`):

| Decision | Rule | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phone format | Digits only, no length check | Accepts local and international numbers. Rejecting separators keeps one canonical form. A length check would wrongly reject some valid numbers. |
| Email format | Contains `@`, no whitespace | Catches obvious typos without a full email grammar. |
| Duplicate contacts | Allowed | Two suppliers can share a name or switchboard number. Unlike `add-i`, a contact has no natural unique key. |
| Optional fields | `e/` before `r/`; a supplied value must not be blank | Matches the fixed prefix order used by every other command. |

Known limitation: prefixes are detected by a shared pattern (a single letter followed by `/` at the start of a
word), so a value containing a word such as `a/b` cannot be entered. This affects every command, not only contacts.
